# GitHub Repository: Towards Scalable Digital Modeling of Networks of Biorealistic Silicon Neurons

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the paper titled "Towards Scalable Digital Modeling of Networks of Biorealistic Silicon Neurons." This repository contains all the code used to produce the results presented in the paper, including implementations in C (floating and fixed point), MATLAB, and Python. The neuron model used in this platform is derived from the FH neuron model as described in the paper "E. Farquhar and P. Hasler, "A bio-physically inspired silicon neuron", March 2005, doi: 10.1109/TCSI.2004.842871."

## Introduction

This repository houses the codebase for the digital modeling of networks of biorealistic silicon neurons, as detailed in the research paper "Towards Scalable Digital Modeling of Networks of Biorealistic Silicon Neurons." Our work draws inspiration from the FH neuron model, as presented in the paper "A Bio-Physically Inspired Silicon Neuron."

## Paper Overview

In our paper, we explore the development of scalable digital models for networks of biorealistic silicon neurons. We present detailed biomimetic Spiking Neural Network implementations in multiple programming languages, including C (floating and fixed point), MATLAB, and Python. These models allow for the simulation and study of the behavior of biorealistic silicon neurons in various contexts.
