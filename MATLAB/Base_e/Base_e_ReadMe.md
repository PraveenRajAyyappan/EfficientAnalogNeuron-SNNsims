# Requirements
Make sure you have version R2023b Matlab installed.

## WTA
This MatLab code uses a Winner-Take-All system to simulate the Farquhar-Hasler Neuron.
The intention here is to facilitate the creation of FXP models with equivalent FP models.
The FP Model: A fixed-step, explicit Euler ODE solver utilizes approximated Base-2 exponents
These FP models are then converetd to FXP. 

# Running WTA Matlab Code
Open the Matlab WTA file in Matlab and run the WTA. 
This will display the output of the 4 inhibitory synapses. 

## Synfire
This Matlab code simulates the biological motor pathways formed via interconnected pools of neurons which having a chain-like firing pattern. Hence the name synfire chain. 

# Running the synfire code
Open the Matlab synfire file in Matlab and run the synfire. 
This will display the output of the
